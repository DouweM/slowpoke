# Slowpoke

Timeouts made easy

- custom error page
- database timeouts
- notifications

**Important note:** [Timing out requests without exiting is unsafe](https://github.com/heroku/rack-timeout/issues/39) - complete solution coming soon

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'slowpoke'
```

And run:

```sh
rails generate slowpoke:install
```

This creates a `public/503.html` you can customize.

The default timeout is 15 seconds. Change this with:

```ruby
Slowpoke.timeout = 10 # seconds
```

or use:

```ruby
ENV["TIMEOUT"] = 10
```

For ActiveRecord (PostgreSQL only), change the database timeout with:

```ruby
Slowpoke.database_timeout = 5
```

Subscribe to timeouts

```ruby
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe "timeout.slowpoke" do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
  # report timeout
end
```
